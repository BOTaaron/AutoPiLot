# AutoPiLot

AutoPiLot is an experimental project for university. The intention is to create a 3D printed plane that is piloted autonomously by a Raspberry Pi 5, along with a number of servos, brushless motor, IMU sensor board, and some cameras. The plane will use the GPS for location mapping and will search a target area using the thermal camera, followed by the video camera if it reads a target. 

It is likely that the project will regularly change dramatically as some things work and other things don't.
